## Projects

### [1. GUI Calculator](https://github.com/Aryan-Ghasoliya/Calculator)
A GUI Calculator is a user-friendly application with a graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Built using Python libraries like tkinter or PyQt, it features buttons for digits, operations, and clear/reset functions. It displays input and results in a text box, mimicking a physical calculator. 


### [2. Advanture Game](https://github.com/Aryan-Ghasoliya/Advanture-Time)
This Python text-based adventure game places players in a dark forest where their choices shape the outcome. Players can follow a path, explore the forest, or climb a tree, each leading to unique scenarios like solving a riddle, encountering a wolf, or discovering a cabin. Success depends on making the right decisions, with outcomes ranging from treasure and escape to “Game Over” scenarios like traps or attacks. The game showcases branching narratives, conditional logic, and user interaction, making it a fun and beginner-friendly coding project.

### [3. GUI Random Password Generator](https://github.com/Aryan-Ghasoliya/Random-Password)
This Python program creates a Random Password Generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It allows users to input a desired password length and generates a secure, randomized password containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program ensures passwords are at least four characters long and include at least one character from each category for security. The interface features input fields for the password length, a button to trigger password generation, and an output field to display the result. It also validates user input and displays error messages for invalid or insufficient password lengths, providing a simple and user-friendly tool for creating secure passwords.

### [4. Simple Buget App](https://github.com/Aryan-Ghasoliya/Buget-App)
This Python code defines a Budget Tracker Application using the pandas library to manage financial transactions. It allows users to add income or expense entries, view all transactions, and see a summary of total income, expenses, and the current balance. Transactions are stored in a DataFrame with details like type, category, amount, and description. The app provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction and updates the balance dynamically based on the transaction type. It offers a simple way to track and manage personal finances.
